        <p class="lead mb-4">Iâ€™m Sandra Eskander, I was born in Brooklyn, New York. I grew up from ages 0-11 in Kuwait and moved to Bakersfield, California 2014. My favorite hobbies growing up were swimming, baking, cooking, and helping people. As I was growing up I became friends with many people that till this day I still consider my friends. My parents signed me up to join the swim team when I was at the age of 5, I have grown up to love swimming. When I go to the beach I usually stay in the water for hours. My friends call me a fish for how long I would stay in the water. As I continue to grow up, swimming became a part of my routine.  In 4th grade my parents put me on the school's swim team. I continued to swim even after I had moved. And over the summer of 2021 I became a lifeguard from how much I enjoyed swimming. During my lifeguard training, I was a certified lifeguard of first-aid, CPR, and WSI. I enjoyed learning about what to do in case of an emergency, especially life threatening emergencies, working with little kids and teaching them how to swim. Helping people was such a great experience because it was important that I was an important factor that affected their life. I grew up in the nature of helping people and always trying to do my best to be there and support people in need. As I grew up, I would always visit the sick, people in need, and people with disabilities. It became a second nature to me and I love keeping it in my life, it gives my life such a greater meaning and importance. <br><br>

        Just like marriage and family counseling. I was lucky enough to grow up in a loving and caring home and I know the importance of having one. My family is my backbone that I always rely on and look for support through. Watching people around me and families and the struggles they go through has always been important to me because it leads me to try and help. Iâ€™m a great listener and a problem solver. The importance of marriage and family is a motive for me to try and fix any issues and problems that could exist. Family is an important factor in everyone's life, which also comes with the loss of family members. Iâ€™m a first hand witness to how hard it is to deal with loss and how difficult it is to get back up on your feet. As I manage to still figure it out, working together on it creates a comforting and productive environment.<br><br>

        I graduated high school in 2021 from Stockdale Highschool in Bakersfield, California. I will be graduating from the University of California, Riverside, in 2025. Iâ€™m a Psychology major, B.A. I have chosen this major because it is important to understand peopleâ€™s minds and behavior. I want to learn peopleâ€™s mind and behavior to know how to work and with them.
